Some information about me
-------------------------

Now I am finishing school in Ukraine (I am in the 10th grade). I would like to devote myself and my time to the field of programming. One of my strengths is to grasp everything quickly. Any information I can absorb very much. I am also calm and accurate in dealing with people, communicative. I have no experience at all, but I have big plans for this in the future. I would like to learn a lot of useful and interesting lessons for myself while taking the course from RS School.
